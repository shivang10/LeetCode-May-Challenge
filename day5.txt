Expaination: The first non-repeating character i.e. the character whose frequency is only 1 in the string.
We will create HashMap for this and store the frequency of the characters.
Then iterate over the string, and as soon as a character with frequency with 1 is found, return that index.
Else return -1.


Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        
        ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        
        int i, n = s.size(), a[26] = {0};
        for(i = 0; i<n; i++)
            a[s[i] - 'a']++;
        
        for(i = 0; i<n; i++)
        {
            if(a[s[i] - 'a'] == 1)
            {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
        
    }
};
