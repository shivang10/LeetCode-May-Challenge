Here, we have to find out the number of stones that we have are jewels also.
We will solve it using Hashing

First we will store or increase the count of alphabets that represent them as Jewels else it will be 0.

Then we will loop through our stones and check if the stone that we have is Jewel or not. If yes, then increase the answer variable.
Return the answer

TC: O(n + m)
SC: O(52) = constant
